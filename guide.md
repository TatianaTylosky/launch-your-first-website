#Build your first website

##Welcome!

###Your mission if you choose to accept it

You're going to build and **launch live on the interwebs** your own amaze website like [this]() or [this]()! AND it will be totally free. Sound to good to be true? [False](http://i.imgur.com/A688v8m.png).

###Why should you do this guide?

Because this stuff is important. Whether you're a business person formatting your emails, an aspiring web designer wanting to get your feet wet, or just someone who is interested and hasn't tried any sort of coding, scripting, or programming before, HTML and CSS are an essential part of your learning curve.

This guide is based on the principle of [project-driven learning](http://blog.thinkful.com/post/100829199278/project-based-v-s-project-driven-learning). We think learning by actually creating something works the best. Throughout this guide we will use GIF images to make everything as clear as possible.

###What do I need?

Yourself, a computer, and the internet. In this tutorial, we'll start from the very beginning. You don't need to know anything about HTML and CSS or anything about code to start so take a deep breath. You've got this.

##Setup and test run

Since a website is just a file, let's start by creating a file. In order to create a file we need a text editor.

Download and open up Sublime Text 2. This is a great text editor. ery clean interface. Once you can navigate it (learning curve isn't that big), it's pretty dreamy. Like your face.

1) Download Sublime Text: Sublime Text is a text editor (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs) made for programmers. It can be downloaded [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) . Download and open it. The initial page should look like this:

  A full featured version of Sublime Text can be downloaded directly from Sublime for free and used forever without paying. The caveat is that it will prompt you to consider paying. It is a great piece of software and if you'd like to support their developers, feel free to do so.

2) Test run. Add your content: In this blank file, you will type the content of your site. type "hello world" and then open up your file in an internet browser.

##Wireframe your personal site

A wireframe is a detailed sketch of your design. In the same way an architect draws a plan of a house before building, create a detailed sketch of what you're looking to build before you start coding. The wireframe we have to work with is fairly detailed:

Keep things simple for your first site. Remember that you can always go back and update with a new version! We've got plenty of examples to give you some inspiration. Try not to spend too much time making this perfect, the goal is to have something you can refer to and work off of when you code up your page.

Note: It's not a bad idea to answer the 'About Me' content questions in Sublime Text and save as a ".txt" file. This will easily allow you to copy and paste the answers into your html file later.
