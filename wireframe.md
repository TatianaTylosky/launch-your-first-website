##Wireframe your personal site

You are going to create a "wireframe". A wireframe is a sketch of your site's design.

###Steps

1) Sketch up your site: In the same way an architect draws a plan of a house before building, make sketch of what you're looking to build before you start coding. Here is an example:

Keep things simple for your first site. Remember that you can always go back and update with a new version! We've got plenty of examples to give you some inspiration. Try not to spend too much time making this perfect, the goal is to have something you can refer to and work off of when you code up your page.

Examples:

2) Write your bio: This will probably take some time, but write the text you would like to display on your site.

Note: It's not a bad idea to write this in Sublime Text and save as a ".txt" file. This will easily allow you to copy and paste the answers into your html file later.

###What did you just do?

Wireframing is an important technique for web development and it will help you organize your thoughts before jumping into codig up your page.
